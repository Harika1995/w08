AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. 

AJAX is a new technique for creating better, faster, 
and more interactive web applications with the help 
of XML, HTML, CSS, and Java Script.

AJAX is a web browser technology independent of web server software.

AJAX cannot work independently. It is used in combination with other technologies to create interactive webpages.
